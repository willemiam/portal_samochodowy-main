# Portal Samochodowy

This project is a full-stack web application for managing car listings. It consists of a Svelte (Vite) frontend, a Flask backend with a SQLite database, and an optional AI enhancement microservice. All services are containerized and orchestrated using Docker Compose for easy local development.

## Features
- User registration and management
- Car listing creation, editing, and filtering with AI-enhanced descriptions
- RESTful API (Flask backend)
- Modern frontend (Svelte + Vite)
- SQLite database (auto-populated from CSV on first run)
- Optional AI description enhancement microservice (FastAPI + HuggingFace)
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 97% code coverage (14 unit tests + 12 integration tests)

## Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Windows, Mac) or Docker Engine (Linux)
- (Optional) [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to inspect the database

## Quick Start (with Docker Compose)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd portal_samochodowy-main
   ```

2. **Build and run the containers:**
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This will start both the backend (Flask) and frontend (Svelte) services.

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

4. **Optional AI Enhancement Service:**
   - If you have the AI microservice setup, it should run on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - The AI service enhances car descriptions automatically when adding new listings
   - Without the AI service, the application works normally but without description enhancement

5. **Database:**
   - The SQLite database (`vehicles.db`) is created automatically in the `backend` folder.
   - On first run, data is loaded from `final_vehicle_data.csv` if present.

## Development Notes
- Any changes to the code will be reflected live if you use the provided `volumes` in `docker-compose.yml`.
- If you add new Python or Node.js dependencies, update `requirements.txt` (backend) or `package.json` (frontend) and rebuild the containers.
- The AI enhancement service is optional and runs separately on port 8000 if available.

## AI Enhancement Service
The application integrates with an optional FastAPI-based AI microservice that:
- Generates enhanced marketing descriptions for car listings
- Uses HuggingFace LLM models for natural language generation
- Expects CarData schema: `{make, model, year, mileage, features[], condition}`
- Returns enhanced descriptions in Polish language
- Runs independently on port 8000 with CORS support

**Without the AI service:** The application works normally, but the "Generate Description" button will show an error message indicating the service is unavailable.

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Backend

The backend includes a comprehensive test suite with 97% code coverage. The tests are built with pytest and follow professional testing standards with proper isolation and mocking.

### Test Suite Overview
- **14 Unit Tests** - Testing core functionality with 100% pass rate
- **12 Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing (10/12 passing)
- **97% Coverage** - Comprehensive code coverage of `app.py`
- **Professional Framework** - pytest with fixtures, mocking, and isolation

### Prerequisites for Testing
Before running tests, ensure you have Python and the testing dependencies installed:

```powershell
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install testing dependencies (if not already installed)
pip install -r test-requirements.txt
```

### Running Tests

#### Option 1: Using the Test Runner (Recommended)
The project includes a convenient test runner with multiple options:

```powershell
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run all tests with coverage report
python run_tests.py

# Run only unit tests
python run_tests.py --unit

# Run only integration tests  
python run_tests.py --integration

# Run tests with detailed coverage report
python run_tests.py --coverage
```

#### Option 2: Direct pytest Commands
You can also run tests directly with pytest:

```powershell
# Navigate to backend directory
cd backend

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/test_app.py

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Understanding Test Output
- **Unit Tests** - Test individual components with mocking (database, CSV loading, configuration)
- **Integration Tests** - Test complete workflows with real database operations
- **Coverage Report** - Shows exactly which lines of code are tested
- **HTML Coverage** - Detailed coverage report generated in `htmlcov/` directory

### Test Structure
```
backend/tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py                 # Test package initialization
â”œâ”€â”€ conftest.py                 # pytest fixtures and configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ test_app.py                 # 14 unit tests for core functionality
â”œâ”€â”€ test_integration.py         # 12 integration tests for workflows
â””â”€â”€ README.md                   # Detailed testing documentation
```

### Key Test Features
- **Isolated Environment** - Each test runs with temporary databases
- **Comprehensive Mocking** - External dependencies properly mocked (pandas, CSV files)
- **Hexagonal Architecture** - Testing `app.py` as complete unit rather than individual functions
- **Professional Standards** - Industry-standard pytest with fixtures and parametrization

### Troubleshooting Tests
- **Import Errors**: Ensure you're in the `backend` directory when running tests
- **Dependencies**: Install test requirements with `pip install -r test-requirements.txt`
- **Database Issues**: Tests use temporary databases, no cleanup needed
- **Integration Test Failures**: 2 tests may fail due to unique email constraints (known issue)

For detailed testing documentation, see `backend/tests/README.md`.

## Useful Commands
- Stop the app: `docker-compose down`
- Rebuild after changes: `docker-compose up --build`

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Docker Desktop is running before starting the project.
- If ports 5000, 5173, or 8000 are in use, stop other services or change the ports in `docker-compose.yml`.
- For database inspection, use DB Browser for SQLite and open `backend/vehicles.db`.
- If the AI enhancement service is not working, check if it's running on port 8000 or if the service is configured properly.
- The application will work without the AI service, but description generation will not be available.
